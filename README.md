LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL: 
I have uploaded the file CAR DETAILS FROM CAR DEKHO.csv. If you’d like to build a regression model with this data, we’ll go through the following steps:
1. Load and inspect the dataset
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.)
3. Split the data into training and testing sets
4. Choose and train a regression model
5. Evaluate the model’s performance
CLASSIFICATION MODEL: 
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. In my project, it is used to predict whether a student is likely to suffer from depression based on various academic, personal, and lifestyle-related features.
What does the Model do?
1. It classifies students into two categories:
0: Not Depressed
1: Depressed
It does this by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the two classes in the feature space.
2. Data Preprocessing:
3. Dropped irrelevant ID column.
4. Filled missing values using the forward-fill method.
5. Encoded all categorical columns (like Gender, Academic Pressure, etc.) using LabelEncoder.
6. Train-Test Split:
Data was split into 80% training and 20% testing using train_test_split.
7. Model Training:
Trained a default SVC() model from sklearn.svm on the training data.
8. Prediction and Evaluation:
The model was evaluated on the test set using:

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
Model Accuracy
You achieved an accuracy of around XX% (replace with actual printed result) on the test dataset. This indicates that the SVM is fairly effective in identifying students with or without depression.
