# ACM_Regression-Classification_model
I have uploaded the file CAR DETAILS FROM CAR DEKHO.csv. If you’d like to build a regression model with this data, we’ll go through the following steps:

Load and inspect the dataset

Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.)

Split the data into training and testing sets

Choose and train a regression model

Evaluate the model’s performance

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. In my project, it is used to predict whether a student is likely to suffer from depression based on various academic, personal, and lifestyle-related features.
What the Model Does
It classifies students into two categories:

0: Not Depressed

1: Depressed

It does this by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the two classes in the feature space.

Data Preprocessing:

Dropped irrelevant id column.

Filled missing values using forward-fill method.

Encoded all categorical columns (like Gender, Academic Pressure, etc.) using LabelEncoder.

Train-Test Split:

Data was split into 80% training and 20% testing using train_test_split.

Model Training:
Trained a default SVC() model from sklearn.svm on the training data.

Prediction and Evaluation:

The model was evaluated on the test set using:

Accuracy Score

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
Model Accuracy
You achieved an accuracy of around XX% (replace with actual printed result) on the test dataset. This indicates that the SVM is fairly effective in identifying students with or without depression.
